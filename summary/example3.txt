DevOps is a portmanteau of the terms development and operations, meant to represent a collaborative or shared approach to the tasks performed by a company's application development and IT operations teams. The term DevOps is used in several ways. In its broadest meaning, DevOps is an operational philosophy that promotes better communication and collaboration between these teams -- and others -- in an organization. In its most narrow interpretation, DevOps describes the adoption of programmable software development, automation and infrastructure deployment and maintenance. The term also labels a culture that oversees the entire software delivery chain and shared services and promotes the adoption of new development tools and best practices. While DevOps is not a technology, but there are tools used commonly in DevOps environments. These include continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment tools, with an emphasis on task automation. Other products to support DevOps include real-time monitoring and incident response systems, as well as collaboration platforms. A DevOps approach can coexist with Agile software development; IT service management frameworks, such as IT Infrastructure Library; project management directives, such as lean and six sigma; and other strategies to execute IT projects to meet business needs. While it is typically associated with Agile development, the two methodologies do not need to be used in concert. Patrick Debois, a software development consultant, is credited with coming up with the term DevOps in 2009 by naming a conference DevOps Days. The concept of DevOps was then popularized with the book.
